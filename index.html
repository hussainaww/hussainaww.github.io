After play testing with over <strong>sixty users</strong>, we realised that our game was the most suitable for kids of the age <strong>6-8 years</strong> old.<br/></p>
                <p class="project_p">From design document to digital prototype, I was responsible for the game design of this project and conducted five play tests, paving a more precise direction for our game. <strong>Rapid paper and digital prototyping</strong> refined most of our game design decisions. To test out stealth, we quite simply got testers to play a game of <strong>hide and seek</strong> with us, to learn the different ducking, sneaking and hiding techniques employed by them. <br/></p>
                <p class="project_p">Some of the feedback we received for our game: “It reminds me of playing hide and seek as a child.”, “I love the whole dinosaur-lava chase.”, “This game is so simple, yet engaging for hours.”.

                <p class="project_p">Being the <b>experience lead designer</b> and the creative director on this project, I designed and helped to develop a working prototype for Zazoo game app. The game essentially consists of more <b>mini games</b>, planned to be released each month with a <b>new mechanic</b> that the kids watching the web series can relate to and play with. </p>
                <p class="project_p">With Zazoo, I have learnt designing for <b>Augmented Reality</b> and applied my knowledge of UX of designing an app for <b>kids</b>, to it.

                <p class="project_p">‘Relapsis’ is a Virtual Reality transmedia story-telling experience based on a dystopic world, set in the year 2080. Artificially intelligent robots have taken over the world and there is a sickness/disease spreading all over. Relapsis was created as a free exploration world for the user, which takes them on a quest to solve a murder mystery, role-playing as a police officer/detective; from the physical world to the web terminal, thereon to a virtual world and back to physical reality.</p>
                <p class="project_p">Roles and Responsibilities: <br/> On this project, I was wearing several hats, such as:</p>
		<p class="project_p"> <b>Production Manager –</b> <br/> Responsibilities: <br/> Planning sprints <br/> Maintaining Trello board <br/> Conducting daily stand ups <br/> Following up on art and design and combining with development work.</p>
                <p class="project_p">Conceptualization to Delivery – all the experiences were separately designed – physical, virtual and web. There are puzzles in both physical and virtual worlds. I had to wear two hats at once, viz., Designer and Production Manager and taking decisions on features like various puzzles, was difficult but achieved through Agile tools, like Bull’s eye and a supportive team.</p> <br/>
		<b>Puzzle Designer –</b> <br/>
		<p class="project_p"> <b>Suspension of disbelief</b> was needed to be achieved through planning each puzzle as if a simulation of the real-world mystery solving case.<br/> The flow of the police officer’s <b>(user) interaction</b> was made seamless by adding a cue at the end of each puzzle that hinted the user to interact with a different world, for eg., When he/she interacted with the web-terminal to check their messages, they were directed to check the criminal reports, in the real world, which further led to findings and hinted them to put on their VR headsets and immerse into a conversation between the A.I. Robot and a doctor trying to work on a cure for the disease that is spreading.<br/>The puzzles led to immersing the user into putting together the pieces of the puzzle and solving the mystery to spot the criminal behind an infamous murder.</p>
                <p class="project_p"> <b>Director of Interaction –</b> <br/>I was responsible for <b>script writing</b> and <b>directing</b> the video call with the police officer’s boss when the he/she is seated in a futuristic automobile which takes flight as soon as the officer(user) puts on the headsets. The video had to be succinct in providing the user with information about their task while immersing them into the role of a police offer/detective, also, introducing them to the aesthetic of the outside reality (virtual), which is a dystopian, cyber punk world with a blade runner aesthetic, based in Neo Bangalore, India.</p>

		<p class="project_p"> <b> What was my role? </b><br>
 Since it was a small  team, I wore many hats. My contributions encompassed these domains:</p>
        <br/>
            <img class="project_image" src="cms/files/projects/Wezrds/myContribution.png" width="800" height="200" alt="screenshot">
		<br/>
        <br/>
<br/>
		<p class="project_p"> <b> Who is the audience? </b> 
        <br>
        The game is designed for young adults who enjoy playing hack-n-slash games. This demographic comprises of people who enjoy storytelling experiences as well as newer technologies, like Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Realities.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="project_p"> <b> Who is the client?  </b>
        <br>
        During the design of the game, my application to the Oculus Start Program was acepted and therefore, Oculus @ Facebook became our first client. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="project_p"> <b> What was our process? </b>
        <br>
        The game takes inspiration from an older iOS version called Knights Rush and WezRds Rush was an attempt to translate mechanics from the mobile game to Virtual Reality. </p>
	    <br>
		</br>
        <p class="project_p"> <i> Week 0 Goal: Prototype ‘flinging’ mechanic as quickly as possible.</i> <br/>
        <br>
        I gathered 5 users, to prototype flinging using rubber balls. They were asked to throw balls that were rolled in front of them, more than one at a time. 
        <br/>
		<br/>
	    </br>
        <b> Observations :</b>
        <br/>
        Users had to bend their necks for a long time to fling those many balls. Each one of them complained about their arms getting tired, yet we fed them pizzas after :p .
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p class="project_p"> <i> Week 1 Goal: Prototype ‘flinging’ mechanic with arms bent at 90 degree.</i></br>
        <br/>
        <b> Observations :</b>
        <br/>
        The same group of users found it more comfortable to fling the same number of balls from a bent arm.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p class="project_p"> <i> Week 2 Goal: Set up a unity project using VRTK  (Virtual Reality Tool Kit). </i><br/>
        <br/>
        <b> Observations :</b>
        <br/>
        VRTK is a great tool to get started with Virtual Reality prototype building in Unity3D. Of course, we evaluated OpenVR and SteamVR too.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p class="project_p"> <i> Week 3 Goal: Prototyping basic interactions with grey boxed Unity scene.</i><br/>
        <b> Workflow :</b>
        <br/>
        Using a simple 3D model for a castle tower, tree assets as well as coloured spheres, we were able to get a scene up and running. <br>
        I tested the position of the tower and iterated upon it, till I was certain I didn’t have to bend my neck to interact with enemies.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p class="project_p"> <i> Week 4 Goal: Set up a base architecture for code and set up camera for first person.</i>
	<br/>
        <b> Workflow :</b>
        <br/>
        A modular code structure was set up as we knew we wanted to build on the game using elements we had prototyped with.<br>
        The camera was tested by me over and over again, especially to eliminate having to look down for long periods of time to interact with enemies.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
	<p class="project_p"> <i> Week 5 Goal: Make enemies move towards you, the player.</i><br/>
        <b> Workflow :</b>
        <br>
        Much balancing, such wow. I spent hours tweaking the speed with which enemies moved towards the player, as well as the number of enemies that were being spawned. The goal was to have enemies that were rolling in your direction.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p class="project_p"> <i> Week 6 Goal:  Make enemies interactive.</i><br/>
        <b> Workflow :</b>
        <br/>
        Each enemy gameObject was given an OnTrigger property and using the left and right controllers laser pointers could be shot at the spheres to select them.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p class="project_p"> <i> Week 7 Goal: Test interactivity of the enemies.</i><br/>
        <b> Observations :</b>
        <br>
        Enemy spheres started colliding with each other  while rolling which disrupted the OnTrigger interaction.  We had to set a NavMesh for each enemy so that it would have a set path to roll towards the you (castle).
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p class="project_p"> <i> Week 8 Goal: Test interactivity of enemies.</i><br/>
        <b> Observations :</b>
        <br/>
        If the right controller shot a laser point at one enemy, the left couldn’t at the same time. We were frustrated, let alone, users.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p class="project_p"> <i> Week 9 Goal: Fix Oculus controllers interaction.</i><br/>
        <b> Observations :</b>
        <br/>
        If the right controller shot a laser point at one enemy, the left couldn’t at the same time. We were frustrated, let alone, users.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <p class="project_p"> <i> Week 10 Goal: Test, Test, Test.</i><br/>
        <b> Workflow :</b>
        <br/>
        Since, the delivery of the prototype was due in 2 weeks to Oculus, I started reaching out to the community and made many business connections, namely, VRAR Association Vancouver, Mythical City Games as well as IndiePod who had previous experience with VR, Oculus Headsets as well as Oculus Start Program application.
        <br/>
        With some useful tips from community forums as well as having showcased our product at the Full-Indie held at the Centre For Digital Media on October 23rd 2018, we were in good shape for Oculus delivery.

		<p class="project_p"> <i> Week 11 Goal: Polish prototype with basic UI and any nice-to-haves.</i><br/>
        <b> Workflow :</b>
        <br/>
        
        <br/>
        In the initial weeks, our testing process had informed us that the must-haves would be essential for the prototype delivery and the nice-to-haves needed prioritization. I used red routing to identify which features were vital to our product based on user feedback.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <img class="project_image" src="cms/files/projects/Wezrds/redRoutes.png" alt="screenshot">
        <br/>
        <p class="project_p"> I performed a Red Route exercise, which allowed me to prioritse our backlog and work towards building the <b>MVP</b> (Minimum Viable Product) as soon as possible. The features in bright red are the ones with most importance as they are used by the players most often and are what really constitute the game. The other features were pushed down in the priority list of features to implement.<br/>
		Through this exercise, we were able to narrow-in on our product.
        <br/>
		</p>
        <p class="project_p"> <i> Week 12 Goal: Test the build, get art in place for submission requirements and press SEND! </i> <br/>
        <b> Observations :</b>
        <br/>
        It wasn’t all smooth-sailing but we made it. Below is some of the art we used to submit our prototype.

        <b>Reflections :</b>
        <br/>
        • Communication between Art, Design and Development teams is key to success. <br/>
        • Prototyping cheaply and efficiently at every stage helps steer ship in the right direction. <br/>
        • Reach out to communities earlier for feedback, thoughts, coffee, all of that good stuff. <br/>
        • Having led a team of 3, and being the only woman, I feel strong and motivated to be in leadership roles. <br/>

I believe that stories are the most powerful tool for human connection and have extended my user experience design, journalism and computer science knowledge towards innovative story-telling and designing interactive products.
			<br/>
			<br/>
I am currently a Product Designer 'Llama' at <a href="https://www.llamazoo.com/" target="_blank"> LlamaZOO Interactive </a> where I work with Mining, Oil, Gas, Aerospace, Medicine and Forestry industries to help visualize their 3D spatial data through Virtual and Augmented Reality.
<br/>
<br/>
Owing to my computer science engineering background, I communicate day in and day out with software developers on my designs to make sure the interaction of products works seamlessly.
I have self-initiated and led two entrepreneurial ventures up until now, an Augmented Reality game for kids and a Virtual Reality game for young adults. Over time, these skills have accrued to shape me into a people-person.
<br/>
<br/>
I also enjoy longboarding, hiking, photography and volunteering for local organizations solving climate change.
