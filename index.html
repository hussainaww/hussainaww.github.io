                <p class="projectTitle">Magma</p>
                <p class="project_p">Magma is a top-down <strong>2.5D</strong> single player, stealth game where the protagonist plays as a dinosaur and has to save his/her village from Magma-enemies by diverting their attention and cleverly making his/her moves to open all the <strong>gates</strong> for the magma to pass through.
After play testing with over <strong>sixty users</strong>, we realised that our game was the most suitable for kids of the age <strong>6-8 years</strong> old.<br/></p>
                <p class="project_p">From design document to digital prototype, I was responsible for the game design of this project and conducted five play tests, paving a more precise direction for our game. <strong>Rapid paper and digital prototyping</strong> refined most of our game design decisions. To test out stealth, we quite simply got testers to play a game of <strong>hide and seek</strong> with us, to learn the different ducking, sneaking and hiding techniques employed by them. <br/></p>
                <p class="project_p">Some of the feedback we received for our game: “It reminds me of playing hide and seek as a child.”, “I love the whole dinosaur-lava chase.”, “This game is so simple, yet engaging for hours.”.

                <p class="projectTitle">Operation Bastion</p>
                <p class="project_p">Operation Bastion is a <strong>3D</strong>, top down, <strong>multiplayer</strong>, twin-stick shooter, based on Relic Entertainment’s <strong>Last Stand</strong> gameplay.This project, with Relic, was accomplished through an <strong>iterative game design</strong> and development process. </p>
                <p class="project_p">The endeavor started with laying out the game’s objectives, and we decided to build new mechanics, hitting the core pillars of Last Stand, ergo operation bastion came into being, which is a LAN multi-player RTS styled <strong>shooter game</strong> designed for the audience that loved and cherished every bit of <strong>Last Stand</strong> and <strong>Company of Heroes</strong>. The game would be played within <strong>30 minutes</strong> and could be learnt by a non-gamer within a couple of minutes.</p>
                <p class="project_p">I was the <strong>game designer</strong> and <strong>producer</strong> on this project and was responsible for brainstorming, game conceptualizing, paper and digital <strong>prototyping</strong>, <strong>play testing</strong> and tweaking <strong>features</strong>, managing <strong>communication</strong> in a more development heavy team, being the point of contact with Relic and enforcing rules of <strong>scrum</strong> with both the teams.</p>
                <p class="project_p">The project has been a great success both at the Centre For Digital Media and Relic Entertainment and presented at <strong>Show ‘n’ Tell</strong> (organised by and at Relic’s HQ).</p>

                <p class="projectTitle">Traverse</p>
                <p class="project_p">Traverse is a <strong>mixed reality game</strong> that uses a <strong>dynamic projection mapping</strong> experience, developed for novice climbers, to promote <strong>rock climbing</strong> as a sport, and for experienced climbers as a warm-up tool. We tested our prototype at three of the most acclaimed gyms in <strong>Vancouver</strong>, namely, The Hive, Cliffhanger and SFU’s indoor climbing facility.</p>
                <p class="project_p">Traverse helped me exercise <strong>Scrum</strong> and <strong>Agile</strong> in more detail, working in close proximity with <strong>developers</strong> and the importance of pivoting, as that played a major role in making our product usable. As a user experience designer; along with <strong>user tests</strong>, <strong>interviews</strong> with <strong>gym owners</strong> and <strong>climbing aficionados</strong>, I took up bouldering classes to better inform the <strong>final design</strong> of Traverse.</p>

                <p class="projectTitle">Zazoo</p>
                <p class="project_p">Zazoo, an IP of BizzyBaby Media, Bombay, India; is an <strong>animated web series</strong> for kids of the age <strong>3 years</strong> up to <strong>12 years</strong> old. The protagonist Za, and his alien best friend Zoo, together explore the <strong>world</strong> of planet Unali. Zazoo’s <strong>Augmented Reality game</strong> app (currently in the design phase) brings to life the character duo and their <strong>playfulness</strong>, for kids of the age 4-7 years old.</p>
                <p class="project_p">Being the <strong>game designer</strong> and the creative director on this project, I designed and helped to develop a working prototype for Zazoo game app. The game essentially consists of more <strong>mini games</strong>, planned to be released each month with a <strong>new mechanic</strong> that the kids watching the web series can relate to and play with. </p>
                <p class="project_p">With Zazoo, I have learnt designing for <strong>Augmented Reality</strong> and applied my knowledge of UX of designing an app for <strong>kids</strong>, to it. While Zazoo was being designed, it was repeatedly tested with my own nephews who fall in the target age group and has given me much insight on laying out the <strong>in-game monetization</strong> structure for apps too.</p>

                <p class="projectTitle">F.A.L.C.O.N</p>
                <p class="project_p">Falcon is a 3D, couch co-op, twin-stick, vehicle-based shooter, created with Blackbird Interactive. Using scrum (for all 14 sprints), the game was brought from inception up to delivery within 3.5 months.</p> 
                <p class="project_p">As the Game User Experience and Level Designer, I collaborated and communicated face-to-face on small, cross-discipline teams, namely, art, development, sound and with co-designers. To enforce the co-operativity in the game, it was designed with a distinctive feature to have both players look at one screen but their characters (vehicles, in this case) would explode, if they went too far from each other; as their cores would be connected. The vehicles were based on animal personalities, such as Rhino and Road Runner, hence, heavy tank and fast and flexible vehicle, respectively.</p>
                <p class="project_p">Laying out the level of the game from a mere flowchart to a final playable prototype in Unreal Engine required obediently listening to my players’ feedback and iterating the design. It was helpful to have used Little Big Planet 2 for rapid prototyping to test the level and the co-op dynamics between play testers.
                                     As the producer of this big team, I made sure the art team was always involved in design and development decisions and vice-versa. Switching from designer to producer hat was quite interesting in terms of features that would stay or frag.</p>
		<p class="project_p">Falcon was pitched by me at PvP (Pitch Vs Pitch) Game Circuit in July 2018, at Blackbird Interactive Studio.</p>

                <p class="projectTitle">Relapsis</p>
                <p class="project_p">‘Relapsis’ is a Virtual Reality transmedia story-telling experience based on a dystopic world, set in the year 2080. Artificially intelligent robots have taken over the world and there is a sickness/disease spreading all over. Relapsis was created as a free exploration world for the user, which takes them on a quest to solve a murder mystery, role-playing as a police officer/detective; from the physical world to the web terminal, thereon to a virtual world and back to physical reality.</p>
                <p class="project_p">Roles and Responsibilities: <br/> On this project, I was wearing several hats, such as:</p>
		<p class="project_p"> <b>Production Manager –</b> <br/> Responsibilities: <br/> Planning sprints <br/> Maintaining Trello board <br/> Conducting daily stand ups <br/> Following up on art and design and combining with development work.</p>
                <p class="project_p">Conceptualization to Delivery – all the experiences were separately designed – physical, virtual and web. There are puzzles in both physical and virtual worlds. I had to wear two hats at once, viz., Designer and Production Manager and taking decisions on features like various puzzles, was difficult but achieved through Agile tools, like Bull’s eye and a supportive team.</p> <br/> <b>Puzzle Designer –</b>
		<p class="project_p"> <b>Suspension of disbelief</b> was needed to be achieved through planning each puzzle as if a simulation of the real-world mystery solving case.<br/> The flow of the police officer’s <b>(user) interaction</b> was made seamless by adding a cue at the end of each puzzle that hinted the user to interact with a different world, for eg., When he/she interacted with the web-terminal to check their messages, they were directed to check the criminal reports, in the real world, which further led to findings and hinted them to put on their VR headsets and immerse into a conversation between the A.I. Robot and a doctor trying to work on a cure for the disease that is spreading.<br/>The puzzles led to immersing the user into putting together the pieces of the puzzle and solving the mystery to spot the criminal behind an infamous murder.</p>
                <p class="project_p"> <b>Director –</b> <br/>I was responsible for <b>script writing</b> and <b>directing</b> the video call with the police officer’s boss when the he/she is seated in a futuristic automobile which takes flight as soon as the officer(user) puts on the headsets. The video had to be succinct in providing the user with information about their task while immersing them into the role of a police offer/detective, also, introducing them to the aesthetic of the outside reality (virtual), which is a dystopian, cyber punk world with a blade runner aesthetic, based in Neo Bangalore, India.</p>
