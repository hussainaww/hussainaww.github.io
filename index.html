                <p class="projectTitle">Magma</p>
                <p class="project_p">Magma is a top-down <strong>2.5D</strong> single player, stealth game where the protagonist plays as a dinosaur and has to save his/her village from Magma-enemies by diverting their attention and cleverly making his/her moves to open all the <strong>gates</strong> for the magma to pass through.
After play testing with over <strong>sixty users</strong>, we realised that our game was the most suitable for kids of the age <strong>6-8 years</strong> old.<br/></p>
                <p class="project_p">From design document to digital prototype, I was responsible for the game design of this project and conducted five play tests, paving a more precise direction for our game. <strong>Rapid paper and digital prototyping</strong> refined most of our game design decisions. To test out stealth, we quite simply got testers to play a game of <strong>hide and seek</strong> with us, to learn the different ducking, sneaking and hiding techniques employed by them. <br/></p>
                <p class="project_p">Some of the feedback we received for our game: “It reminds me of playing hide and seek as a child.”, “I love the whole dinosaur-lava chase.”, “This game is so simple, yet engaging for hours.”.

                <p class="projectTitle">Operation Bastion</p>
                <p class="project_p">Operation Bastion is a <strong>3D</strong>, top down, <strong>multiplayer</strong>, twin-stick shooter, based on Relic Entertainment’s <strong>Last Stand</strong> gameplay.This project, with Relic, was accomplished through an <strong>iterative game design</strong> and development process. </p>
                <p class="project_p">The endeavor started with laying out the game’s objectives, and we decided to build new mechanics, hitting the core pillars of Last Stand, ergo operation bastion came into being, which is a LAN multi-player RTS styled <strong>shooter game</strong> designed for the audience that loved and cherished every bit of <strong>Last Stand</strong> and <strong>Company of Heroes</strong>. The game would be played within <strong>30 minutes</strong> and could be learnt by a non-gamer within a couple of minutes.</p>
                <p class="project_p">I was the <strong>game designer</strong> and <strong>producer</strong> on this project and was responsible for brainstorming, game conceptualizing, paper and digital <strong>prototyping</strong>, <strong>play testing</strong> and tweaking <strong>features</strong>, managing <strong>communication</strong> in a more development heavy team, being the point of contact with Relic and enforcing rules of <strong>scrum</strong> with both the teams.</p>
                <p class="project_p">The project has been a great success both at the Centre For Digital Media and Relic Entertainment and presented at <strong>Show ‘n’ Tell</strong> (organised by and at Relic’s HQ).</p>

                <p class="projectTitle">Traverse</p>
                <p class="project_p">Traverse is a <strong>mixed reality game</strong> that uses a <strong>dynamic projection mapping</strong> experience, developed for novice climbers, to promote <strong>rock climbing</strong> as a sport, and for experienced climbers as a warm-up tool. We tested our prototype at three of the most acclaimed gyms in <strong>Vancouver</strong>, namely, The Hive, Cliffhanger and SFU’s indoor climbing facility.</p>
                <p class="project_p">Traverse helped me exercise <strong>Scrum</strong> and <strong>Agile</strong> in more detail, working in close proximity with <strong>developers</strong> and the importance of pivoting, as that played a major role in making our product usable. As a user experience designer; along with <strong>user tests</strong>, <strong>interviews</strong> with <strong>gym owners</strong> and <strong>climbing aficionados</strong>, I took up bouldering classes to better inform the <strong>final design</strong> of Traverse.</p>

                <p class="projectTitle">Zazoo</p>
                <p class="project_p">Zazoo, an IP of BizzyBaby Media, Bombay, India; is an <strong>animated web series</strong> for kids of the age <strong>3 years</strong> up to <strong>12 years</strong> old. The protagonist Za, and his alien best friend Zoo, together explore the <strong>world</strong> of planet Unali. Zazoo’s <strong>Augmented Reality game</strong> app (currently in the design phase) brings to life the character duo and their <strong>playfulness</strong>, for kids of the age 4-7 years old.</p>
                <p class="project_p">Being the <strong>game designer</strong> and the creative director on this project, I designed and helped to develop a working prototype for Zazoo game app. The game essentially consists of more <strong>mini games</strong>, planned to be released each month with a <strong>new mechanic</strong> that the kids watching the web series can relate to and play with. </p>
                <p class="project_p">With Zazoo, I have learnt designing for <strong>Augmented Reality</strong> and applied my knowledge of UX of designing an app for <strong>kids</strong>, to it. While Zazoo was being designed, it was repeatedly tested with my own nephews who fall in the target age group and has given me much insight on laying out the <strong>in-game monetization</strong> structure for apps too.</p>

      I believe that stories are the most powerful tool for <strong>human connection</strong> and have extended my
<strong>user experience design</strong>, <strong>writing and computer science</strong> knowledge to designing games and
<strong>innovative storytelling</strong>.
<br>
<br>
I chose to become a game designer after I graduated as a Bachelor Of
Computer Science and Technology from University of Pune, India. While pursuing my master’s
degree in <strong>Digital Media</strong>, I had a chance to work with <strong>Relic Entertainment</strong> and <strong>Blackbird
Interactive</strong> on projects where I played game designer and project manager roles. I have also
been the production manager for creating <strong>immersive experiences</strong> through virtual and
augmented reality.</p>
