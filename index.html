After play testing with over <strong>sixty users</strong>, we realised that our game was the most suitable for kids of the age <strong>6-8 years</strong> old.<br/></p>
                <p class="project_p">From design document to digital prototype, I was responsible for the game design of this project and conducted five play tests, paving a more precise direction for our game. <strong>Rapid paper and digital prototyping</strong> refined most of our game design decisions. To test out stealth, we quite simply got testers to play a game of <strong>hide and seek</strong> with us, to learn the different ducking, sneaking and hiding techniques employed by them. <br/></p>
                <p class="project_p">Some of the feedback we received for our game: “It reminds me of playing hide and seek as a child.”, “I love the whole dinosaur-lava chase.”, “This game is so simple, yet engaging for hours.”.

                <p class="project_p">With Zazoo, I have learnt designing for <b>Augmented Reality</b> and applied my knowledge of UX of designing an app for <b>kids</b>, to it.

                <p class="projectTitle">Relapsis</p>
                <p class="project_p">‘Relapsis’ is a Virtual Reality transmedia story-telling experience based on a dystopic world, set in the year 2080. Artificially intelligent robots have taken over the world and there is a sickness/disease spreading all over. Relapsis was created as a free exploration world for the user, which takes them on a quest to solve a murder mystery, role-playing as a police officer/detective; from the physical world to the web terminal, thereon to a virtual world and back to physical reality.</p>
                <p class="project_p">Roles and Responsibilities: <br/> On this project, I was wearing several hats, such as:</p>
		<p class="project_p"> <b>Production Manager –</b> <br/> Responsibilities: <br/> Planning sprints <br/> Maintaining Trello board <br/> Conducting daily stand ups <br/> Following up on art and design and combining with development work.</p>
                <p class="project_p">Conceptualization to Delivery – all the experiences were separately designed – physical, virtual and web. There are puzzles in both physical and virtual worlds. I had to wear two hats at once, viz., Designer and Production Manager and taking decisions on features like various puzzles, was difficult but achieved through Agile tools, like Bull’s eye and a supportive team.</p> <br/>
		<b>Puzzle Designer –</b> <br/>
		<p class="project_p"> <b>Suspension of disbelief</b> was needed to be achieved through planning each puzzle as if a simulation of the real-world mystery solving case.<br/> The flow of the police officer’s <b>(user) interaction</b> was made seamless by adding a cue at the end of each puzzle that hinted the user to interact with a different world, for eg., When he/she interacted with the web-terminal to check their messages, they were directed to check the criminal reports, in the real world, which further led to findings and hinted them to put on their VR headsets and immerse into a conversation between the A.I. Robot and a doctor trying to work on a cure for the disease that is spreading.<br/>The puzzles led to immersing the user into putting together the pieces of the puzzle and solving the mystery to spot the criminal behind an infamous murder.</p>
                <p class="project_p"> <b>Director of Interaction –</b> <br/>I was responsible for <b>script writing</b> and <b>directing</b> the video call with the police officer’s boss when the he/she is seated in a futuristic automobile which takes flight as soon as the officer(user) puts on the headsets. The video had to be succinct in providing the user with information about their task while immersing them into the role of a police offer/detective, also, introducing them to the aesthetic of the outside reality (virtual), which is a dystopian, cyber punk world with a blade runner aesthetic, based in Neo Bangalore, India.</p>

		<p class="project_p">Using simple interactions on the Rift controllers, you will be able to destroy these tiny monsters before they barge in. It is a <b>First person defence</b> game and because you are a giant, you are atop the huge castle and can see enemies clearly all around you.
			<br />
		The game takes inspiration from an older iOS game called Knights Rush (now obsolete), which appealed to us because of it's simple flinging mechanic and we decided to implement that mechanic into our game instead of doing the neurotypical hack-n-slash, shooters and bow & arrow in VR.

		<p class="project_p"> As part of the UX exercise, while laying down features for the game, I did a Red Route exercise, which allowed me to <b>prioritse our backlog</b> and work towards releasing the <b>MVP</b> (Minimum Viable Product) as soon as possible. The features in bright red are the ones with most importance as they are used by the players most often and are what really constitute the game. The other features were pushed down in the priority list of features to implement, but still accounted into the MVP.<br />
		Through this exercise, we were able to narrow-in on our MVP.

        <b> End users </b> <br/>
	 The game is primarily designed for K-12 (10th to 12th grades) high school students in Vancouver and Delta, British Columbia. They would be expected to play this game in a classroom setting and optionally in a non-classroom setting too. </p>
		<br/> <br/>	 <b> Client </b> <br/>
			
			Two types of clients:
			<br/>
			• High schools --> For example, Kitsilano High School students have interacted with this WIP game and the teachers have shown a high interest in using this tool to educate students on climate change.
			<br/>
			• Vancouver School Board --> They would be our distributer in Vancouver, catering to all schools that agree to teach climate change in their classrooms.

			I am a Product Designer 'Llama' at <a href="https://www.llamazoo.com/"> LlamaZOO Interactive </a> where I work with Mining, Oil and Gas and Forestry industries to help visualize their 3D spatial data through Virtual and Augmented Reality.     
<br/>
<br/>
Owing to my <b>computer science engineering background</b>, I communicate with software developers on my designs to make sure the interaction of products works seamlessly. I have self-initiated and led two entrepreneurial ventures up until now, an Augmented Reality game for kids and a Virtual Reality game for young adults. Over time, these skills have accrued to shape me into a <mark>people-person</mark>. 
<br/>
<br/>
			
Prior to LlamaZOO, I was leading a team of designers and developers to build 3D solutions to educate high school students on climate change in Vancouver,BC. I believe that stories are the most powerful tool for human connection and have extended my <mark> user experience design </mark>, <mark> journalism </mark> and <mark> computer science </mark> knowledge to designing <b> interactive products </b> and innovative story-telling. 
<br/>
<br/>
I chose to design products for users,after I graduated as a Bachelor Of
Computer Science and Technology from University of Pune, India. While pursuing my master’s in <u>Digital Media</u> from Vancouver, I had opportunities to work with <mark>Relic Entertainment</mark> and <mark>Blackbird Interactive</mark> on prototypes where I played <b> Experience designer</b> and <b>Product manager</b> roles.
<br/>
<br/>
When not pushing pixels, coding, or attending conferences about innovative design and tech, I can be found geeking out with the latest Nintendo games, exploring bigger cities like NY, SF and their interactive museums, or hiking the mountains in Vancouver. I also enjoy volunteering with climate change solution teams and organizations.
